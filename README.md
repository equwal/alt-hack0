# Hack with an alternative zero.

Like [Hack](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) fonts? Dislike
zeros with vertical strikes? Then this package is for you. Desktop (ttf)
and web (woff) fonts included.

Generated with [alt-hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/alt-hack) glyphs,
and [the `generator.ros` Common Lisp script](https://github.com/equwal/alt-hack/tree/generator.ros).

The zeros:

[![dotted zero](zero-doot.png)]

The old zero:
[![vertical slashed zero](hack-vertz.png)]
